            <h2>About Biowave</h2>
            <p>This project was created in 3 weeks, and was my first foray into code-based game development. I've been interested in indie game dev for quite a while, and wanted to use this opportunity to get a feel for what developing a game might look like. Turns out, it's very challenging, especially in Javascript!</p>
            <p>Initially, Biowave was intended to be a turn-based RPG similar to Pokemon or Earthbound, but my instructors suggested I start with a simple overworld and implement battling if I have time. That advice ended up being extremely valuable, as development took much longer than anticipated and I had to redesign sections of code several times in order to get a product I was happy with. While the game may seem bare-bones, the final product took hours upon hours of work learning about Phaser, planning systems, implementing them, and ironing out the bugs. (So many bugs...)</p>
            <p>I see this project more as a learning experience than an attempt to create a full-fledged game. I overcame a lot of challenges to make this project work, regardless of how simple it may appear while playing. It has also motivated me to learn more about game development as a whole, and to dive into programs like Unity that make the creation of complex games a bit easier than code alone.</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy my little game! :)</p>
